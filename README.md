# SCOPE-C Reveals Key Roles of Long-Range Enhancer Networks in Human Cortical Neurogenesis

SCOEP-C*, Hi-C, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, (sc)RNA-seq Analysis. 
 
*SCOPE-C (Simultaneously Capture of OPEn-chromatin and Conformation) is a 3D multi-omics technology enabling to effectively enrich open chromatin and their detailed spatial contacts capable of only 1,000 cells.

All code used to process the SCOEP-C data can be found in: 
bash/s0.utils.Mapping and bash/s1.utils.CallPeakAndLoop

All code used to generate the figures can be found in:
